## Introduction

This is my first attempt at creating/ maintaining a personal website. 

The plan is for it to be a personal blog. My own small corner of the net. 

I am starting with a clean template titled, "brutalist blog" from Andrew Hwan Park. Thanks, dude!

#### Features

- Automatically changes from dark/light modes depending on the OS settings.
- Easy integration with Google Analytics.
- Generates XML sitemap and RSS Atom feed.
- jekyll-seo-tag to add metadata tags for search engines and social networks to better index and display your site's content.
- Full markdown support: code blocks and tables are automatically bootstrap components.

### Adding content

In order to add permanent pages, add in similar fashion to about.md and portfolio.md and add apppropriate data to \_data/navigation.yml.

In order to add blog posts, add in similar fashion to \_posts/2021-07-16-this-post-demonstrates-post-content-styles.md.

### Custom style changes

If you wish to add custom styling through SCSS or CSS, you can add or edit \_sass/main.scss.
